Design Description
The code utilizes the joystick to contorl the sound of the produced by the buzzer.
The y axis will produce no sounds when pushed all the way down and max when up.
The x axis will produce low sounds when pushed left and high sounds when pushed right.
Note:
	These ranges are EASILY changed in code. Lower and upper bound are defined in the code and can easily be adjusted.
	The top button overrides the volume control and sets it to 0 to eleminate annoyance to user
		Pressing the button again will toggle the control and return contorl to the user
	And excel file has been included to find the relationship between inputs and frequency if one would like to adjust the ranges
	
Code Description
	The Joystick acts as a potentiometer to read in user inputs as voltage. This data is converted to usable ranges.
	The range of volumes is 0 to 99. The range of frequencies is 200 to 2000.  
	The code utilizes interrupts and sleep conditions to save power.  
	The following libaries were used:
	
	/*inclluded in MSPWARE*/
	#include "driverlib.h"

	/* Standard Includes */
	#include <stdint.h>
	#include <stdbool.h>
